	abstract = {Remote sensing often used in geothermal exploration because it was considered has many advantages. The aim of this research is to extract and analyze the lineament density in the Libungo geothermal area based on a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Lineament is obtained from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) satellite image data downloaded from the Geospatial Information Agency (BIG) page. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data processing uses Geomatica aplication to extract the lineament automatically. Extracted lineament is processed using Geographic Information System (GIS) aplication to produce a lineament density map and processed using Rockworks aplication to generate direction. Lineament density maps help identify permeability in the Libungo geothermal area. Based on the results of the extraction and lineament density analysis, it is interpreted that the Libungo geothermal area has a high-density value. High density values are associated with good permeability. A direction that affect lineaments in the Libungo geothermal area are northwest-southeast in the direction of Gorontalo's main geological structure.},

	abstract = {Manual extraction of topographic features from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) images is a quick, cost effective and powerful tool to produce lineament maps of fractured basement areas. This commonly used technique, however, suffers from several biases. In this contribution, we present the influence of (1) scale, (2) illumination azimuth and (3) operator, which significantly affect results of remote sensing expressed as number, orientation and length of the mapped lineaments. Six operators (N1–N6) with differing experience in remote sensing and different Earth sciences backgrounds mapped the same LiDAR DEM of a fractured bedrock terrain located in western Norway at three different scales (1:20.000, 1:10.000, 1:5.000) and illuminated from three different azimuths (045°, 180°, 315°). The 54 lineament maps show considerable output variability depending on the three factors: (1) at larger scales, both the number and the orientation variability of picked lineaments increase, whereas the line lengths generally decrease. (2) Linear features oriented perpendicular to the source of illumination are preferentially enhanced. (3) Inter-operator result reproducibility is generally poor. Operators have different perceptions of what is a lineament. Ironically, this is particularly obvious for the results of the “most experienced” operators, seemingly reflecting a stronger conceptual bias of what lineaments are and an operational bias on how they should be mapped. Based on these results, we suggest guidelines aimed to improve the reliability of remote sensing lineament interpretations.},

	abstract = {Korea has been recognized as an earthquake-safe zone, but over recent decades, several earthquakes, at a medium scale or higher, have occurred in succession in and around the major fault zones, hence there is a need for studying active faults to mitigate earthquake risks. In Korea, research on active faults has been challenging owing to urbanization, high precipitation, and erosion rates, and relatively low earthquake activity compared to the countries on plate boundaries. To overcome these difﬁculties, the use of aerial light detection and ranging (LiDAR) techniques providing high-resolution images and digital elevation models (DEM) that ﬁlter vegetation cover has been introduced. Multiple active fault outcrops have been reported along the Yangsan Fault, which is in the southeastern area of the Korean Peninsula. This study aimed to detect active faults by performing a detailed topographic analysis of aerial LiDAR images in the central segment of the Yangsan Fault. The aerial LiDAR image covered an area of 4.5 km by 15 km and had an average ground point density of 3.5 points per m2, which produced high-resolution images and DEMs at greater than 20 cm. Using LiDAR images and DEMs, we identiﬁed a 2–4 m high fault scarp and 50–150 m deﬂected streams with dextral offset. Based on the image analysis, we further conducted a trench ﬁeld investigation and successfully located the active fault that cut the Quaternary deposits. The N–S to NNE-striking fault surfaces cut unconsolidated deposits comprising nine units, and the observed slickenlines indicated dextral reverse strike-slip. The optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age dating results of the unconsolidated deposits indicate that the last earthquake occurred 3200 years ago, which is one of the most recent along the Yangsan Fault.},

	abstract = {Abstract. We describe a semi-automatic method to objectively and reproducibly extract lineaments based on the global one arc-second ASTER GDEM. The combined method of linear filtering and object-based classification ensures a high degree of accuracy resulting in a lineament map. Subsequently lineaments are differentiated into geological and morphological lineaments to assign a probable origin and hence a hydro-geological significance. In the western catchment area of the Dead Sea (Israel) the orientation and location of the differentiated lineaments are compared to characteristics of known structural features. The authors demonstrate that a strong correlation between lineaments and structural features exist, being either influenced by the Syrian Arc paleostress field or the Dead Sea stress field or by both. Subsequently, we analyse the distances between lineaments and wells thereby creating an assessment criterion concerning the hydraulic significance of detected lineaments. Derived from this analysis the authors suggest that the statistic analysis of lineaments allows a delineation of flow-paths and thus significant information for groundwater analysis. We validate the flow-path delineation by comparison with existing groundwater model results based on well data.},

Lineament features were analyzed by means of azimuth frequency and length density distributions. Three major sets of lineaments trending W–E, ENE-WSW and WNW-ESE are identified in the South Cameroon area. These trends are probably related to repeated reactivation of pre-existing crustal structures during Eburnean and Pan-African tectonic episodes. The lineaments were formed under the compressional tectonic stress regimes generated during these tectonic events.},

	abstract = {Lineament extraction from satellite remotely sensed data has been one of the widely used applications of remote sensing in geology. In fact, recent advances in digital image processing allow such lineament extraction to be accomplished in semi-automatic to fully automatic approaches. However, satellite remotely sensed data acquired in heavily vegetated regions such as tropical rainforest, are vulnerable to higher inherent noise levels attributed to the resultant eﬀects of scattering by clouds and adjacency eﬀects of highly inhomogeneous vegetation cover within the pixel dimension. In this study, we examined the eﬀects of noise levels to lineament extraction using a fully automatic approach, consisting of a combination of edge-line detection algorithms. Ancillary information from a digitized topographic map and image classiﬁcation was used to discriminate between cultural and natural lineaments from the extracted lineaments. Adapting the combination of edge detection and a line-linking algorithm, we have found the optimal parameters for automatic lineament extraction of such complex areas using Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data. A noise level of 30\% is the maximum threshold before artifacts are generated. It is therefore concluded that the combination of edge-based and line-linking digital image processing operations with the priori local optimal parameters is crucial in lineament feature extraction in heavily vegetated regions.},

The extraction of lineaments from remotely sensed satellite data is one of the most frequently used applications of remote sensing in geology. This study focuses on the semi-automatic extraction of lineaments in the Girón–Santa Isabel basin using a Topographic Position Index (TPI). The lineaments were extracted in the PCI Geomatics 2016 software and analyzed in the ArcGIS and Rockworks software. Statistical and density map analyses of the lineaments were performed; then, these results were interpreted to obtain the geological lineaments. Finally, a bibliographic veriﬁcation was carried out, and structures such as faults and folds were deﬁned. The total number of geological lineaments was 76, and 71 of them were deﬁned as faults, the longest with a length of 33 km. It was determined that the preferential orientation of the lineaments is NE–SW, which is consistent with the axis of the Girón–Santa Isabel basin. This methodology can be useful to optimize time and reduce costs when gathering the structural information of the study area in the ﬁrst stage of geological and mining prospecting or the educational ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Regional lineament detection for mapping of geological structure can provide crucial information for mineral exploration. Manual methods of lineament detection are time consuming, subjective and unreliable. The use of semi-automated methods reduces the subjectivity through applying a standardised method of searching. ObjectBased Image Analysis (OBIA) has become a mainstream technique for landcover classiﬁcation, however, the use of OBIA methods for lineament detection is still relatively under-utilised. The Southwest England region is covered by high-resolution airborne geophysics and LiDAR data that provide an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the power of OBIA methods for lineament detection. Herein, two complementary but stand-alone OBIA methods for lineament detection are presented which both enable semi-automatic regional lineament mapping. Furthermore, these methods have been developed to integrate multiple datasets to create a composite lineament network. The top-down method uses threshold segmentation and sub-levels to create objects, whereas the bottom-up method segments the whole image before merging objects and reﬁning these through a border assessment. Overall lineament lengths are longest when using the top-down method which also provides detailed metadata on the source dataset of the lineament. The bottom-up method is more objective and computationally eﬃcient and only requires user knowledge to classify lineaments into major and minor groups. Both OBIA methods create a similar network of lineaments indicating that semi-automatic techniques are robust and consistent. The integration of multiple datasets from diﬀerent types of spatial data to create a comprehensive, composite lineament network is an important development and demonstrates the suitability of OBIA methods for enhancing lineament detection.},

As the result, it is determined that the optimal scale of edge detection is 4, and the outline that consist of the edge pixels is roughly corresponding to the geological structure of mine area. Thus the incomplete lineaments have been extracted by using the 2D otsu algorithm. Secondly, the hillshade map generated based on DEM is processed to generate binarized linear shadow. Finally, the linear shadow is superimposed on the lineaments preliminarily extracted to obtain the optimized lineaments. Experiment results show that, based on the method, there are some deformation and displacement between the lineaments extracted and the actual geological structure, and it fail to eﬀectively extract Qilinchang Fault, but lineaments are in good correspondence with Kuangshanchang Fault, Dongtou Fault and Niulan River Fault, which are basically in accord with the geological structure framework of the mine area.},

Extracted lineaments were draped over Cartosat DEMderived ancillary products to understand the morphotectonic condition of the area. The orientation analysis of the extracted lineaments indicates that the major trend of linear features in the study area is NW–SE and parallel to the major structural trend (NNW–SSE). The trend of lineaments is in concordance with the direction of major faults, fractures, and associated geomorphological features. The lineament density value is relatively higher in the high relief area owing to the presence of fractured rocks to the structurally active terrain along the Siwalik range. The overlapping of lineament over geological map, slope aspect map, and drainage map conﬁrms that some of the lineaments identiﬁed in the area are morphological features associated with fractures and faults. The study reveals that analysis of extracted lineament with the geological map and DEM gives a good interpretation of active morphotectonics in the parts of northwestern HFT.},

	abstract = {The extraction of lineaments from Digital Elevation Models plays an important role in inhospitable and inaccessible mountain forest areas. In this study, the lineaments extracted from different data acquisition techniques; stereo pairs (ALOS (30m), ASTER (30m), CARTOSAT (30m)), and InSAR (SRTM (30m, 90m), TanDEM-X (90m)) are compared. There is a quantifiable difference in the extracted lineaments from 30m and 90m resolution DEMs due to the different data acquisition methods and processing algorithms used. CARTOSAT provides a more number of lineaments than other DEMs. The length of the lineaments extracted is inversely proportional to the vertical accuracy of the DEM over the region. All the DEMs have a consistency in the orientation of the lineament extracted. The DEMs generated from stereo-images have shown higher lineament density than the DEMs acquired through the InSAR technique. This study shows the difference in the lineament extracted from the same resolution DEMs acquired through various acquisition techniques and helps in the selection of suitable DEM for lineament extraction in the dense forest area.},

The core of the proposed Multi-Hillshade Hierarchic Clustering (MHHC) method incorporates a set of variously illuminated and rotated hillshades in combination with hierarchic clustering of derived ‘protolineaments’. The algorithm also includes classiﬁcation into positive and negative lineaments. MHHC was tested in two different territories in Bohemian Forest and Central Western Carpathians. The original vector-based algorithm was developed for comparison of the individual lineaments proximity. Its use conﬁrms the compatibility of manual and automatic extraction and their similar relationships to structural data in the study areas.},

	abstract = {Detection and analysis of linear features related to surface and subsurface structures have been deemed necessary in natural resource exploration and earth surface instability assessment. Subjectivity in choosing control parameters required in conventional methods of lineament detection may cause unreliable results. To reduce this ambiguity, we developed LINDA (LINeament Detection and Analysis), an integrated tool with graphical user interface in Visual Basic. This tool automates processes of detection and analysis of linear features from grid data of topography (digital elevation model; DEM), gravity and magnetic surfaces, as well as data from remote sensing imagery. A simple interface with ﬁve display windows forms a user-friendly interactive environment. The interface facilitates grid data shading, detection and grouping of segments, lineament analyses for calculating strike and dip and estimating fault type, and interactive viewing of lineament geometry. Density maps of the center and intersection points of linear features (segments and lineaments) are also included. A systematic analysis of test DEMs and Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery datasets in the North and South Eastern Deserts of Egypt is implemented to demonstrate the capability of LINDA and correct use of its functions. Linear features from the DEM are superior to those from the imagery in terms of frequency, but both linear features agree with location and direction of V-shaped valleys and dykes and reference fault data. Through the case studies, LINDA applicability is demonstrated to highlight dominant structural trends, which can aid understanding of geodynamic frameworks in any region.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present the framework and open-source software code to train and apply Deep Learning Con­ volutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the prediction of geological lineaments using topographic, magnetic, and gravity raster data. Many important applications relate to the recognition of linear geological structures from remote sensing data, such as thrust faults, bedrock fault and shear zones, lithological contacts, fractures and fold structures. The digitization of fault lineaments is conventionally performed by geologists or geophysicists with working knowledge of the relevant data, e.g., topographic Digital Elevation Model, magnetic data, and gravity data. Visual inspection and extraction is simple but subjective; the process is also time-expensive with efficiency and accuracy depending on the individual’s knowledge, experience, and skill. For decades there has been interest in ways to automate this process. Our CNN approach is trained using publicly available lineament GIS data from the Quest BC project in British Columbia, Canada, and the Loch Lilly-Kars area of New South Wales, Australia. The datasets used to train the prediction models resulted in interesting predictions proximal to the training areas: some major lineaments are indicated, some are missed, and potential new (valid) lineaments are indicated. The results indicate potential for use as a semi-automated lineament detection solution. In contrast, but as antici­ pated, application of the model to the blind-test area of the Swayze greenstone belt, Ontario, produced poor lineament prediction results (as compared to publicly available interpretations). We interpret this result as related to insufficiently large training data inputs. However, it is inferred that results could be improved through feature engineering (e.g., use of topographic slope, rather than simply elevation) without the need to simply create larger training datasets. We hope that, by making the code open-source, the geoscience community will use this platform to gradually improve an open source fault prediction model.},
